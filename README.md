# ND Starter Theme

Github project link: https://github.com/nickdavis/nd-starter

This theme is designed to be used as a starter WordPress theme for all https://designtowebsite.com projects. ND Starter is a a Genesis child theme, meaning it also requires the Genesis Framework (available to purchase separately via http://my.studiopress.com/themes/genesis/) to function.

Apart from Genesis, ND Starter is designed to work with the ND Core (core functionality) plugin and, where available, any related 'Project' Core (core functionality) plugin. Without these plugins installed and activated, theme functionality may be limited.

## Installation Instructions

1. Upload the ND Starter theme folder via FTP to your wp-content/themes/ directory. (The Genesis parent theme needs to be in the wp-content/themes/ directory as well).
2. Go to your WordPress dashboard and select Appearance.
3. Activate the ND Starter theme.

## Theme Support

You are free to use this theme for your own project, but support is only provided to https://designtowebsite.com clients.

Special thanks to Alain Schlesser, Tonya Mork, Bill Erickson, Gary Jones and Brian Gardner, as well as all Genesis contributors past and present. Thanks also to everyone who has contributed to 10up's Engineering Best Practices (https://10up.github.io/Engineering-Best-Practices/), many of which have influenced the direction of this theme.
